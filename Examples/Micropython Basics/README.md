# Micropython Examples for the DualMCU ESP32+RP2040 

This repository contains MicroPython examples for the DualMCU ESP32+RP2040, a microcontroller board featuring both an ESP32 and an RP2040 microcontroller. The examples demonstrate various capabilities of the DualMCU board and provide a starting point for developing applications using MicroPython, a Python implementation for microcontrollers. The examples can be used with the Thonny IDE, a simple Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, running, and debugging Python programs.
