  							         Typical		Max
  Active Current:  			  50uA		  75uA
  Sleep-Mode Current:		  0.5-1uA		1-3uA
  Output Logic-Low: ALRT	0.4V		  0.4V
  Mode Transition: tTRAN	1ms			  1ms
			-Time to enter sleep after Sleep command is sent.
			-Time to exit sleep on rising edge of SCL or SDA.
			
  The first update occurs within 250ms after POR of the IC. 
  
  Battery voltage is measured at the CELL pin input with respect to GND over a 0 to 5.00V range 
  with resolution of 1.25mV. The A/D calculates the average cell voltage for a period of 125ms
  after IC POR and then for a period of 500ms for every cycle afterwards. The VCELL register
  requires 500ms to update after exiting Sleep mode. The result is placed in the VCELL register
  at the end of each conversion period.
  
  In the Command Register Address, in lsb, default/Power Up is:
  0x1C in Hex, 28 decimal, and 00011100 binary
  
  	11100 - ATHD (Alert Threshold) - The power-up default value for is 4%.
  			ATHD UNITS: 1 LSB = 2ï¿½S COMPLEMENT 1%, ATHD RANGE: 11111b = 1% - 00000b = 32%
  	0 - ALRT (ALERT Flag) - The power-up default value for ALRT is logic 0.
  	0 - X
  	0 - SLEEP (Sleep Bit) - The power-up default value for SLEEP is logic 0

	0x9C, 156 decimal, and 10011100 binary would ensure SLEEP which is logic 1
