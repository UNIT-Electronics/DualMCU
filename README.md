### Description

Unit DualMCU brings the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller plus an Espressif ESP32 WROOM chip in a simple one module, make the most of the dual core 32-bit Arm® Cortex®-M0+ to make Internet of Things projects with Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi connectivity. 

DualMCU has been thought of as a mix between two 32-bit microprocessors: a Raspberry RP2040 cortex M0+ running at 133 Mhz and an Espressif ESP32 running up to 240 MHz, in this way we implement all the power of both microcontrollers in a single development card. With a PCB size of 36mm x 84mm and using surface mount technology, four programmable cores with wireless functions and features are found with very low power consumption.

### Applications.

Internet of Things (IoT), prototyping, machine learning, evaluation & development.


### Support. 

The DualMCU development board is compatible with the Micropython Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Thonny, and also with the Arduino development environment. This means that you can use these development environments to program the DualMCU using both the Micropython or Circuitpython programming languages, as well as the Arduino programming language.

The support for the Micropython IDE includes an interactive console (REPL) for executing commands immediately in Micropython and Circuitpython. This allows you to easily and quickly test and debug your code.

Additionally, support for the Arduino development environment allows you to use the tools and extensive community available through Arduino to develop projects with the DualMCU development board. This can be especially useful if you are already familiar with Arduino and want to take advantage of its ease of use and wealth of resources.
