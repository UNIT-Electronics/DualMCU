### Description

Unit DualMCU brings the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller plus an Espressif ESP32 WROOM chip in a simple one module, make the most of the dual core 32-bit Arm® Cortex®-M0+ to make Internet of Things projects with Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi connectivity. 

DualMCU has been thought of as a mix between two 32-bit microprocessors: a Raspberry RP2040 cortex M0+ running at 133 Mhz and an Espressif ESP32 running up to 240 MHz, in this way we implement all the power of both microcontrollers in a single development card. With a PCB size of 36mm x 84mm and using surface mount technology, four programmable cores with wireless functions and features are found with very low power consumption.

### Applications.

Internet of Things (IoT), prototyping, machine learning, evaluation & development.


### Support. 

DualMCU is supported in the  Arduino development environment and Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Thonny via an interactive prompt (REPL) to execute commands immediately in mycropython and circuitpython programming language.
